	Where do the values that are fed into an operand come from when an
	instruction is executed using the three address style?
}{
	Memory.
	\vspace{1em}\\
	The resulting value is also copied to a destination address in memory.
}

\card{
	Why are registers faster than memory?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{l X}
		- & Implemented using a flip flop or some other very fast volatile
		storage (rather than smaller, cheaper SRAM).\\
		- & Situated inside the processor, so there's less distance for the
		data to travel, which takes less time.\\
		- & Fewer of them so address decoding takes less time\\
		- & Data doesn't need to be transferred over a bus.\\
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	What is the {\it one-address} style of instruction?
}{
	Where only one memory address may be used in any one instruction. The other
	operands must be registers.
}

\card{
	Describe the {\it load-store} style of instruction.
}{
	The only operations on memory are load and store operations. This means each
	instruction is very fast and very simple, but there are many instructions.
}

\card{
	How is code written in ARM Assembly run?
}{
	It is first assembled using an assembler into machine code. Then it is
	loaded into memory and executed sequentially.
}

\card{
	What is the instruction to load a value at a memory address into a register?
}{
	{\tt LDR <register> <memory\_address\_alias>}
}

\card{
	What is the instruction to store a value in a register to a memory address?
}{
	{\tt STR <register> <memory\_address\_alias>}
}

\card{
	What is the instruction to sum two numbers?
}{
	{\tt ADD <destination\_register> <operand\_register1> <operand\_register2>}
}

\card{
	What is the instruction to branch upon a condition?
}{
	{\tt B <condition> <branch\_name>}
}

\card{
	What does the program counter do? What register is it?
}{
	It is used to store the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.
	\vspace{1em}\\
	It's register 15.
}

\card{
	When is the {\tt DEFW} command executed. What does it do? What's its syntax?
}{
	It is executed before the program runs.
	\vspace{1em}\\
	It stores a value at a memory address and assigns the address an alias.
	\vspace{1em}\\
	{\tt <alias> DEFW <value\_1>, ... <value\_n>}
}

\card{
	What does {\tt DEFB} do?
}{
    {\tt DEFB} stores a single byte in memory. If you give it a string, the
	whole string will be stored (in multiple bytes).
}

\card{
	What's the syntax of {\it DEFS}?
}{
	{\tt <alias> DEFS <number\_of\_bytes>, <value\_of\_bytes>}
}

\card{
	What does {\tt STRB} do? What is it's syntax?
}{
	Stores the lowest eight bits of a register into memory.
	\vspace{1em}\\
	{\tt STRB <register> <memory\_alias>}
}

\card{
	What does {\tt LDRB} do? What is it's syntax?
}{
	Loads the lowest eight bits of a specific memory address into a register. 
	The other bits in the register are set to zero.
	\vspace{1em}\\
	{\tt LDRB <register> <memory\_alias>}
}

\flashcard{When using Little Endian, bytes are read from \blank{left} to \blank{right}.}

\flashcard{When using Big Endian, bytes are read from \blank{right} to \blank{left}.}

\card{How many bits are assigned to a literal in an ARM instruction}{12}

\card{
	What command should be used to load a literal into a {\it register}
}{
	{\tt LDR <register> =<literal>}
	\vspace{1em}\\
	Note, this is a pseudo instruction, that is converted to either {\tt MOV
	<register> \#<literal>} or it will define a constant and load that in from
	memory.
}

\card{
	How do you load an address into a register so you can use it as a pointer?
}{
	{\tt ADR <register>, <alias>}
	Now the {\tt <register>} will hold the memory location (and is therefore a
	pointer to) the alias.
}

\card{
	What does {\tt DEFW <number>} do?
}{
	It reserves a word of memory initialised to {\tt <number>}
}

\card{
	What does {\tt DEFB <value>} do?
}{
	It reserves a byte(s) of memory with the value {\tt <value>}. If a string is
	passed as the value, multiple bytes will be reserved, each with the value of
	a character.
}

\card{
	What does {\tt DEFS <size>, <fill>} do?
}{
    It reserves a block of memory {\tt <size>} bytes long initialised to the
	value {\tt <fill>}.
}

\card{
	What does {\tt ALIGN} do?
}{
	Leaves blank bytes in memory so that the next {\tt DEFINE} command will 
	start on a word boundary.
}

\card{
	What does {\tt ENTRY} do?
}{
	Sets the PC at the start of the program (i.e. dictates where the program
	should) start from.
}

\card{
	What does {\tt EQU} do?
}{
	{\tt EQU} allows us to name a literal. You can then refer to the literal 
	(still with a hash before it) by name in your code which is easy to read.
	\vspace{1em}\\
	{\tt <alias> EQU \#<value>}
}

\card{
	What are the four status flags provided by the ARM architecture?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{l X}
		- & Negative\\
		- & Zero\\
		- & Carry\\
		- & Overflow\\
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	How can you combine a CMP instruction with another instruction?
}{
	Append {\tt S} to an instruction. E.g.:\\
	{\tt SUBS R0, R1, R2}\\
	If the result in {\tt R0} was negative, then the negative flag would be set
	etc etc.
}

\card{
	What does {\tt RSB} do?
}{
	Reverse subtract. {\tt RSB R1, R0, \#0}:\\
	{\tt R1 = 0 - R0 = -R0}
}

\card{
	What does {\tt MLA} do?
}{
	Multiply and add. {\tt MLA R0, R1, R2, R3}:\\
	{\tt R0 = (R0 * R1) + R2}
}

\flashcard{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.4\textwidth}{l X}
		Condition code & Meaning (for cmp or subs)\\ \hline
		eq & \blank{Equal}\\
		ne & \blank{Not equal}\\
		ge & \blank{Signed greater than or equal}\\
		le & \blank{Signed less than or equal}\\
		lt & \blank{Signed less than}\\
