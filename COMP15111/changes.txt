1- little endians are read from right to left
2- no comma in between LSL and literal #2
3- fixed the interrupt handler table :)
4- fixed typos here and there.

5- should "Process manager - manages the CPU time between different processes to facilitate multitasking." instead of facilitate, fake or simulate? As it is not a real multi-processing?  

6- added the other definition to compilers steps. and clarified that code optimization is a compiler and not an assembler job 

7- accessing arrays: load base address is clearer than load base pointer IMO.
