\section*{Introduction}

This course continues from COMP16121, using the same book 'Java Just in Time'
plus some additional material.

\section*{Aims}

Building on COMP16121, this course unit continues the theme of Object Oriented
Design and Programming. The remaining core features of the language will be
covered and some library packages will be introduced. Design principles for
human-computer interfaces will also be taught.

Program design will be addressed by the use of a number of case studies in which
larger programs will be developed from informal requirements expressed in
English and this development will include the process identifying objects,
classes and methods.

A practical introduction to team-working will be achieved through the mini-
project that runs throughout the course unit.

The syllabus includes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Inheritance, polymorphism and collections
	\item GUIs
	\item Recursion and recursive datatypes
	\item Principles of HCI
	\item Advanced case studies
\end{itemize}
