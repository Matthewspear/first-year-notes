}{
	Any change on a click tick is intrepreted as a 0, and no change is
	intrepreted as a 1. Bit stuffing is used to encode a zero (i.e. a change in
	the signal) if there are six consecutive 1's. This enables the clock signal
	to be extracted from the main signal.
}

\card{
	What are the characteristics of an asynchronous serial communication?
}{
	There is no clock signal transmitted. Both parties agree on the length of
	data packets and an approximate frequency of transmission. Every few bytes,
	they need to re-synchronise their timing to ensure that their clocks do not
	deviate too far apart.
}

\card{
	Describe strobing.
}{
	A seperate wire will carry a strobe signal. This signal will go high when
	data is in a bus ready to be transmitted. When the data has been read, the
	signal will go low indicating the transfer has finished.
}

\card{
	Describe handshaking.
}{
	Handshaking requires two seperate wires; a request line and an acknowledge
	line. When data is to be sent, the requst line goes high, and when the
	reciever recognises that, it will set the acknowledge linme high. The data
	is then transferred, and the request line will go low when the transfer has
	finished, to which the reciever will reply by setting the acknowledge line
	low.
}

\card{
	What is Time Domain Multiplexing?
}{
	TDM is when a connection with high bandwidth is split into many small
	timeframes so that many 'virtual' connections can be established over it.

	How do you work out the maximum clock frequency of a processor knowing only
	it's critical path?
}{
	\[
		frequency = \frac{1}{time} = \frac{1}{\textrm{\it cricical path}}

	What are the three main buses used in computers?

	\begin{tabular}{l}

\card{
	Is the bandwidth of a memory cache higher or lower than that of the RAM?
}{
	Higher - it's faster.
