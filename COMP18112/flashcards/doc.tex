% Lecture II - Axioms and fallacies of distributed computing
%===============================================================================

\card{
	Define bandwidth.
}{
	Bandwidth measures the maximum amount of data that can be communicated
	within a certain amount of time.
}

\card{
	Define throughput.
}{
	Throughput measures the actual rate at which messages are communicated.
}

% Lecture III/IV - Transparency
%===============================================================================

\card{
	On a graph diagram of a distributed system, what is represented by the nodes on the graph?
}{
	The physical nodes of the network (individual systems). Each can host multiple processes and resources.
}

\card{
	Name some properties of edges that connect the nodes in a graph of a distributed system.
}{
	The type of connection (wired/wifi/mobile data etc).\\

	The bandwidth.

	The latency.
}

\card{
	Why is it that even though connections between nodes can be implemented in different ways (such as wifi or Ethernet), they can be treated as the same?
}{
	The implementation details of each connection is abstracted away by many layers of protocols.
}

\card{
	Name the eight axioms of distributed systems.
}{
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		$\cdot$ & Latency is greater than zero.\\
		$\cdot$ & Bandwidth is less than infinite.\\
		$\cdot$ & Transport cost is greater than zero.\\
		$\cdot$ & There is more than administrator.\\
		$\cdot$ & The network topology can and will change.\\
		$\cdot$ & The network is not homogeneous (the nodes and edges differ).\\
		$\cdot$ & The network is not secure.\\
		$\cdot$ & The network is not reliable.\\
	\end{tabular}
}

\card{
	Why is transparency desirable in a distributed system?
}{
	It allows us to design systems as though the distributed axioms were false.
}

\card{
	What is transparency of location? How can we achieve it?
}{
	An attempt to hide the need to know of where a specific resource is physically located.\\
	Use DNS servers to map host names to IP addresses.
}

\card{
	What is transparency of migration? How can we achieve it?
}{
	When a host moves location in the network, we shouldn't need to the details of the move.\\
	The DNS architecture implements this, though if a resource keeps moving, then the route through the network and therefore the latency of the connection to the host is hard to predict.
}

\card{
	What is transparency of relocation? How is it achieved?
}{
	Transparency of relocation is when parts of the system move while they are being accessed. This is hard to mitigate, and is often a problem with mobile phone communications.
}

\card{
	What is transparency of replication. How is it achieved?
}{
	When there is more than one physical resource that does the same job, which one do we use? It is hard to achieve.
}

\card{
	What is transparency of access? How is it achieved?
}{
	Transparency of access is the ability to not care about how a node is implemented. This is often achieved using protocols and API's and middleware.
}

\card{
	What is transparency of concurrency?
}{
	Different users shouldn't need to know that others are using the same resource and may be competing for its time. Atomic operations and enforcing consistency are ways to achieve this, but this can force users to wait on each other (deadlock, livelock etc).
}

\card{
	What is deadlock?
}{
	When two different processes are unable to progress since each is waiting for information from the other.
}

\card{
	What is livelock?
}{
	When two processes change with respect to one another so that neither can make progress.
}

\card{
	What is transparency of failure? How is it achieved?
}{
	Users should not know that a specific node has failed or has recently had downtime. Hard to ensure, since sometimes slow connections are indistinguishable from failed nodes.
}

% Lecture VIII - Systems Software Evolution
%===========================================================================

\card{
	Define systems software.
}{
	The underlying level of software which allows applications to perform their
	tasks efficiently. Examples include device drivers and the operating system.
}

\card{
	Describe the start of the mainframe era.
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{lX}
		- & Hardware was vastly more expensive than people.\\
		- & Only single user programs.\\
		- & Programs had to be written every time they were to be run.\\
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	What advances were made during the mainframe era?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{lX}
		- & The ability to store programs was developed.\\
		- & Batch processing, where jobs would be written to a queue to be
			executed. Lost the ability to debug.\\
		- & Use interrupt handlers and buffers to allow the CPU and IO to work
			in parallel.\\
		- & Multiprogramming so that one program has the CPU and another has the
			IO to enable full resource utilisation.
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	What is the danger of multiprogramming?
}{
	One program could potentially have access to data in other programs, which
	could present security/compatibility concerns. Memory protection is used so
	that programs can only read and write stuff they own.
}

\card{
	What three things can help multiprogramming be effective?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{lX}
		- & Fairness policies that impose limits on how much resources jobs 
			should use\\
		- & Schedulers that aim to minimise the time it takes to complete jobs,
			by reducing their response and turnaround time.\\
		- & Preemptive scheduling will temporarily stop jobs if they are hogging
			resources.\\
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	How does the scheduler make decisions about programs?
}{
	Give them priority levels.
}

% Lecture IX - Systems Software Evolution: From PCs to Smartphones
%===============================================================================

\card{
	In the beginning of the PC era, what was a typical PC like?
}{
	Everything was cut back with just a single user in mind; no timesharing,
	multiprogramming or protection in the OS, few resources such as memory and
	CPU power etc.
}

\card{
	What happens to the price of PC's during the PC era?
}{
	Price falls due to commoditization and competition.
}

\card{
	How does the usage of PC's change during the PC era?
}{
	They become used for more simple tasks such as word processing, rather than
	number crunching and enterprise processing.
}

\card{
	What does WIMP stand for and when was it introduced?
}{
	Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer\\ \vspace{1em}
	The WIMP system became common during the PC era.
}

\card{
	What drove an increase in security focus during the PC era?
}{
	The fact that sharing data over networks was becoming increasingly common,
	which exposed security risks. Authentication and authorisation methods were
	therefore developed.
}

\card{
	What are the four standard layers of the network protocol stack?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{lX}
		{\bf Name} & {\bf Example}\\
		Application Layer & {\tt HTTP}, {\tt POP}, {\tt SSL}\\
		Transport Layer & {\tt TCP}, {\tt UDP}\\
		Internet Layer & {\tt IP}, {\tt ICMP}, {\tt IGMP}\\
		Link Layer & {\tt ARP}, {\tt Ethernet}, {\tt DSL}, {\tt ISDN}\\
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	When did middleware start to become widely used?
}{
	At the beginning of the web era. API's are used to provide a generic
	interface between the OS and programming languages so that system calls are
	no longer needed. The OS must support middleware rather than implementing
	functions itself.
}

\card{
	In the device era, CPU cycles, storage space and power is all limited. How
	is this overcome?
}{
	Make use of connectivity to servers to offload computation somewhere else.
	This is called the cloud.
}

\card{
	Since there are millions of requests sent to data centres in the device era,
	how is the demand handled?
}{
	Elastically scalable architectures made up of commodity hardware are developed
	along with middleware such as hadoop and map reduce in order to allow for
	massively parallel computation.
}

% Lecture X - Distributed Systems: Contrasted with Centralized Ones
%===============================================================================

\card{
	What is the aim of the operating system with regard to resource management?
}{
	To make the most efficient use of the available resources as possible.
}

\card{
	How is memory access controlled by the operating system?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{l X}
		- & The OS assigns a {\bf unique identity} to each process.\\
		- & Each process is then assigned an {\bf address space}\\
		- & The OS ensures each process $P$ has a single address space $A$ that
		    is exclusive to that process.
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	Why is it important that a process only have access to isolated areas of
	memory?
}{
	So that processes cannot interfere with each others memory, because of a
	bug or malicious intent.
}

\card{
	Each process executes in a sequential manner, what is a disadvantage of
	this?
}{
	If there was some task that took ages to do, say an API request over a slow
	network connection, then it might be sensible to execute other tasks (maybe
	preparing data for another API request) while the current task is executing
	(i.e. make the tasks concurrent). Due to the sequential nature of processes,
	this is not done.
}

\card{
	What is a {\bf scheduling policy} with regard to operating systems?
}{
	A method of granting each process a time during which it is executed,
	enabling multiple processes to execute in a concurrent fashion, even though
	there may be only one physical set of resources.
}

\card{
	Describe forking.
}{
	When a process forks (through an OS system call) the following happens:
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{l X}
		- & A child process is created\\
		- & It is given a copy of the parent process's address space, though
		    each address space is distinct.\\
		- & This causes two copies of the process to be active concurrently.
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	Describe threading.
}{
	When a new thread is created in a process:
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{l X}
		- & A new child process is created\\
		- & The address space is shared between the child and the parent.\\
		- & The parent and child processes are less isolated, and can therefore
		    interact together easier, however, this can be dangerous and a
		    source of bugs.\\
		- & Since the no memory is copied, threading is less expensive than
		    forking.
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	When there are many independent, self-sufficient, autonomous, heterogeneous
	machines working together with spatial separation, what is required to
	facilitate effective working?
}{
	Message exchange over a network, best facilitated with a middleware API to
	abstract away some complexity.
}

% Lecture XI - Distributed Systems: Interconnecting them
%===============================================================================

\flashcard{
	A significantly long interconnect (i.e. a \blank{full blown network}) is not
	\blank{cost-neutral}.
}

\card{
	Describe an SISD architecture.
}{
	A single instruction/program, single dataset architecture. An example of
	this is an older, single core PC, where there is only data space (the main
	memory) and there is cost neutral access to it.
}

\card{
	Describe an SIMD architecture.
}{
	A single instruction/program, multiple dataset architecture. This could be
	used to describe a computer with a GPU that is applying {\bf the same}
	transformation to many pixels at once. Access to data is {\bf not} cost
	neutral since the data is being shared amongst different instances of a
	program/instruction.
}

\card{
	Describe a MISD architecture.
}{
	A multiple program/instruction, single dataset architecture. Though not as
	useful as other architectures, a sample MISD use case is in safety critical
	systems where two independent processors could compute the same function on
	the same data and check their results against each other.
}

\card{
	Describe a MIMD architecture.
}{
	A multiple instruction/program, multiple dataset architecture. Here, a
	form of interconnect will bind together several self sufficient autonomous
	components. The interconnect isn't cost neutral, but the gain in
	functionality is great. This architecture is widely used in applications
	such as clouds, clusters, and even multi-core PC's.
}

\card{
	Describe the advantages of a MIMD architecture.
}{
	A MIMD architecture allows you to scale out instead of up. An architecture
	that lets you scale out is one where you can add more hardware (such as
	servers/hard drives) as opposed to upgrading existing hardware which is
	scaling up (i.e. increasing the RAM in a server).

}

\card{
	Describe the job of the application layer.
}{
	To take care of specific application needs such as sending emails or HTTP

}

\card{
	Describe the job of the transport layer.
}{
	To make sure that there is a logical channel for messages to flow through.
	E.g. TCP
}

\card{
	Describe the job of the Internet layer.
}{
	To make sure packets sent over the network reach their intended destination.
	E.g. IP
}

\card{
	What is the job of the link layer?
}{
	Making sure that there is a physical channel to pass data through. E.g. MAC
}

\card{
	What is the job of the physical layer?
}{
	To physically pass messages between networked components. Deals with all

}

\card{
	What is the hourglass model?
}{
	Very varied application layers at the top of the network stack (emails,
	streaming video etc), as simple protocols as possible in the middle of the
	stack, and very varied physical devices at the bottom (bluetooth, wifi,
	optical fibre etc).
}

\card{
	What is a packet switched network?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{l X}
		- & A network of networks formed by interconnecting routers.\\
		- & The message is divided into packets before transmission.\\
		- & The packets are reconstituted into the original message at
			reception.\\
		- & Packets may take varied routes while in transit, and be grouped with
			unrelated packages from other messages.\\ 
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	What is the job of a router in a packet switched network?
}{
	To examine the header data in each packet and send the packet on to another
	router in the network that is closer to the packet's destination, while
	accounting for how saturated datapaths are in order to find an efficient
	route.
}

\card{
	What are some differences between TCP and UDP?
}{
	\begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{l X}
		- & TCP is connection oriented, UDP isn't.\\
		- & TCP is reliable and ensures that messages arrive at their
				destination, intact and in the right order. If the messages do
				not arrive, then it will be known. UDP only provides a
				corruption guarantee.\\
		- & UDP is more lightweight than TCP and is better for quick
			communication where the occasional loss or out of order packet isn't
			a problem.
	\end{tabularx}
}

\card{
	What is packet encapsulation?
}{
	Each layer of the networking stack wraps messages in a packet that contains
	information about the packet. By the time the packet has descended to the
	physical layer, then it may have many layers of headers and metadata.
}

\card{
	Why does packet encapsulation enable flexibility?
}{
	It doesn't matter about what information the packet is carrying, at each
	layer of the network stack, the callee layer has multiple choices of what
	protocol to use for the next level on the stack, and simply chooses the most
	convenient/suitable one.

% Lecture XII - Distributed systems - Architectural Paradigms
%===============================================================================

\card{
	What does IPC stand for?
}{
	Inter-Process Communication
}

\flashcard{
	A successful communication between processes must consist of one process
	being \blank{ready to send} coinciding with another process being
	\blank{ready to receive}. This is non trivial with \blank{independent
	timelines}.
}

\card{
	Describe Direct Message Exchange as a Distributed Architecture.
}{
	In order to communicate, the sending process must be in a position to send
	and the receiving process must be in a position to receive messages. Upon
	receiving a message, a process may interpret it and then respond.
}

\card{
	What is asymmetric DME?
}{
	Direct Message Exchange	where processes are assigned special roles such as a
	client or server in order to simplify the process. All the server has to do
	is wait for messages and all the client has to do is send messages.
}

\card{
	What is a symmetric DME?
}{
	Direct Message Exchange	where no special roles are assigned to processes,
	also known as a peer-to-peer architecture. Event synchronisation is less 
	simple with a symmetric DME than with an asymmetric one.
}

\card{
	What is a MME architecture?
}{
	A Mediated Message Exchange architecture is one where inter process
	communication goes through a central middleware component (often referred
	to as message orientated middleware). Allows for event synchronisation to be
	decoupled in time since the middleware is always avalible.
}

\flashcard{
	If a message in a MME architecture goes to more than one destination it is
	described as being a \blank{public subscribe system}, if messages only go
	to one destination, then the system is described as being \blank{point to
	point}.
}

\card{
	What is RPC?
}{
	A remote procedure call is similar to a message, though the data is passed
	as parameters to a method. It is often facilitated by middleware such as
	{\tt CORBA}. When OOP principles are involved, RPC is called {\bf Remote
	Method Invocation (RMI)}.
}

\card{
	Why is middleware such as MME, RPC and RMI beneficial?
}{
	They raise the level of abstraction at which we can build and engineer
	distributed systems.

\card{
	What is the function of the {\tt HEAD} HTTP verb?
}{
	Provides metadata about a resource. Just like a {\tt GET} request, except
	the body of the request is not returned. Used to let clients know if cached
	data has changed.
}

\card{
	What is the function of the {\tt GET} HTTP verb?
}{
	Gets a resource from the server.	
}

\card{
	What is the function of the {\tt POST} HTTP verb?
}{
	Submits data to the server. The state of the server may change as a result
	of a {\tt POST} request.
}

\card{
	What is the function of the {\tt OPTIONS} HTTP verb?
}{
	Returns the list of commands supported by the server.
}

\card{
	What does the 'store and forward' model mean?
}{
	When a message needs to be transmitted along a network, but not all the
	nodes along the path may be active at the same time. Consequently, the
	message is stored by each node until it has been confirmed to have been
	received by the next node.
}

\card{
	What is the SMTP protocol?
}{
	The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is a method for sending email. It is a
	stateful, connection based protocol, so a connection to the server must be
	opened before the message can be transferred, and then closed again after.
}

\card{
	Describe 'reduction to absurdity'.
}{Manchester University: a place where you get a score of 29/30 and yet still 78.7%
	This is a type of argument where an idea is shown to be false by showing

\card{
	Describe the purpose of a mutex.
}{
	A mutex ensures that two processes do not enter into a critical section of
	their execution at the same time and therefore prevents race conditions and
	enables the safe sharing of resources.
}

\card{
	What is a critical section?
}{
	A critical section is a sequence of actions that should execute in an atomic
	matter. That is to say that if the critical section does not succeed, then
	the state of the system should be exactly the same as when the critical
	section started.

}{
	In order to synchronise the clocks of two systems, one system $S$ will send
